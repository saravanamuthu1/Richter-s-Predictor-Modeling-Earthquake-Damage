# Richter-s-Predictor-Modeling-Earthquake-Damage
The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:

    1 represents low damage
    2 represents a medium amount of damage
    3 represents almost complete destruction
